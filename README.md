# 💖 Arduino 8x8 LED Matrix Heart Animation

Welcome to my first hardware project! This repository contains the code to create a pulsing heart animation on an 8x8 LED matrix using an Arduino Uno and the MAX7219 driver.

### 🚀 About this Project
I created this project as part of my mission to make hardware and electronics accessible and fun, especially for girls and tech-beginners. It demonstrates how a few lines of code and some jumpers can bring a physical component to life.

### 🛠 Hardware Needed
* Arduino Uno
* 8x8 LED Matrix (with MAX7219 driver)
* 5 Jumper wires
